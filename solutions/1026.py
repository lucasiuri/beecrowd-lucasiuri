# Look at, Mofiz worked hard throughout his Digital Logic course, 
# but when he was asked to implement a 32 bit adder for the laboratory 
# exam, he did some mistake in the design part. After scavenging the 
# design for half an hour, he found his flaw!! He was doing bitwise 
# addition but his carry bit always had zero output. Thus,


# 4  = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000100
# +6 = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110
# ----------------------------------------
# 2  = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010

# It’s a good thing that he finally found his mistake, but it was 
# too late. Considering his effort throughout the course, the instructor 
# gave him one more chance. Mofiz had to write an efficient program that 
# would take 2 unsigned 32 bit decimal numbers as input, and produce an 
# unsigned 32 bit decimal number as the output adding in the same way 
# as his circuit does.

# Input

# In each input line there will be a pair of integer separated by a single 
# space. Input ends at EOF.

# Output

# For each input line, the program must provide an output's line: the value 
# after adding the two numbers in the "Mofiz way".
